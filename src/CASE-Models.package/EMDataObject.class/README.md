I am an abstract class.  Instances of my concrete subclasses represent data objects.

Data object - A potential collection of attribute types, often used to describe a business object in a structured manner.
Identifier - One or more attribute types whose values taken together can distinguish uniquely and unambiguously all instances of a data object.

Instance variables:
