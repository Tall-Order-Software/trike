I am an abstract class.  Instances of my concrete subclasses represent data types modeled using Ronald G. Ross' conventions, as presented in Appendix  1 of _The Business Rule Book: Classifying, Defining and Modeling Rules_ 2nd edition.  A better reference would be _Entity Modeling: Techniques and Applications_, but my author can't say how well this implementation corresponds.   Perhaps you should buy her a copy.

Data type - Any component of a data model with the potential to possess or represent actual data on a persistent basis.
