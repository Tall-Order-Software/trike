Here are the differences:	- rowCount and columnCount in GridLayoutProperties explicitly control the number of rows and columns	- each row and column is of uniform height or width, i.e. all Morphs in a row have the same height (that of the tallest Morph in the row), and all Morphs in a column have the same widthBecause you can control rowCount and columnCount, you probably will also want to control the row & column of each submorph; you can do this using a vile hack like this:row _ self rowCount + 1.self rowCount: row.self addMorph: newMorph asElementNumber:	(self layoutPolicy indexFromGridSquare: 1@row horizontal: true).This would add newMorph at the beginning of a new last row.	This package is very, very alpha.  It definitely depends on Dynamic Layout Menu.  It may also depend on Elliptical Layout, since I have some fixes to Morph>>adjustLayoutBounds there.  I have tested most of the setting combinations in the table layout menu, but I have not tested everything, e.g. dropping a Morph in a Morph using a GridLayout.' id '31f58742-2572-8241-b3e2-dc791cd8d3f1' date '17 January 2005' time '12:00 am' author 'BEL' ancestors () stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())
