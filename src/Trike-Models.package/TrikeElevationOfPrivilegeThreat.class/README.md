My instances represent threats of the form:
	Actor performs disallowed Action (elevates privilege) on Asset.
	
These threats come in two categories:
	actor, action, asset tuples (TrikeActions) which are not listed in the assessment's list of legitimateActions at all
	actor, assset, action tuples which are allowed in some circumstances, but do not adhere to the rules listed for them in legitimateActions
